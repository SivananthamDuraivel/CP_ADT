/*  Given an integer N, the task is to print the pattern below for the given value of N. 
Input: N = 4 
Output: 
1020304017018019020 
**50607014015016 
****809012013 
******10011

Input: N = 3 
Output: 
10203010011012 
**4050809 
****607 
Approach: The idea to understand the logic behind the given pattern is stated below:

By looking closely, we see that by replacing in-between zeroes with spaces, the pattern can be seen more clearly. The pattern is further divided into three different patterns.

Case 1: Asterisk (*) character pattern follows a sequence from 0 and adds two more asterisks in each row, where the row is equal to N.
Case 2: In this part, the pattern is very simple to understand. i.e the number of columns and rows will be equal to N and follows a sequence like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5â€¦
Case 3: Follow-up or bottom-up sequence is the interesting part where the numbers are represented from bottom to top.

SOLUTION:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n,v=10,x,i;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int s=n*n+1;
    for( i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        for(int j=0;j<i;j++)
            printf("**");
        for(int k=0;k<n-i;k++)
        {
            printf("%d",v);
            v+=10;
        }
        x=s;
        for(int l=0;l<n-i;l++)
        { 
            if(l==n-i-1)
                printf("%d",s);
            else 
                printf("%d0",s);
            s++;
        }
        printf("\n");
        s=x-(n-i-1);
        
    }
    
}
