Count and Say
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, . . .
1 is read off as one 1 or 11.
11 is read off as two 1s or 21.
21 is read off as one 2, then one 1 or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
Example:
if n = 2,
the sequence is 11.
